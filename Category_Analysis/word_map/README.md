# Word Map

In this directory, we try to visualize words and their dependencies by running a small simulation.

Words are displayed in a 2D field, and attract each other, for each article they share / repulse each other for each article they don't share. The more often the words appear, the higher their attraction / repulsion is.

The following gif shows the simulation, where the words orient each other on the map over time. The words are coloured by the category they appear most in. Also the more ofthen they appear, the bigger their circle is.

We can see, that most words start building groups in their own categories. Either in one big group, or many smaller groups. The simulation has not reached its equilibrium state yet, but the result is already clear.
